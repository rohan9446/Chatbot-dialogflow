# Chatbot-dialogflow
Dialogflow is a natural language understanding platform used to design and integrate a conversational user interface into mobile apps, web applications, devices, bots, interactive voice response systems and related uses.
I designed this bot for answering major queries of a technical fest Tantrotsav as part of a competition held in our college
It can be generalized for any customer service based applications.
